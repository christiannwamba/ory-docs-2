"/docs/guides/permissions/overview"|"Get started with Permissions in the Ory Network | Ory"|"Ory Permissions uses Google Zanzibar for relations between subjects and objects
Relations encode subject-object relationships, where the subject ID references the object ID
Permissions are another form of relations, used to check if a subject has access to an object through indirections
Example:
- user1 is in members of groups:group1, so they have access to files:file1 (all members of group:group1 are readers)
- user2 is not in group1, so they do not have access to file1

Ory Permission Language (OPL) for configuring namespaces and relationship rules
Example setup: file store with folder hierarchy, accessible by individual users or groups of users
Using OPL, specify that a user has access to a folder means they also have access to all files in that folder

Fastest way to get started with Ory Permissions using Ory Console
Switch to Permission Rules tab in Ory Console and use autocompletion for OPL
Connect to Ory Network using Ory CLI:
- Sign in to account
- List workspaces and projects
- Use project ID to create permission rules
Create relationships in Ory Network project using Ory CLI
Save relationships as JSON file (e.g. relationships.json)
Run queries illustrating use cases:
- Patrik can view keto/src/main.go due to group membership
- Patrik cannot view private file due to lack of access
- Henning has edit and view access to private file due to ownership"|"2025-01-29T12:08:33.636Z"

"/docs/migrate-to-ory/"|"Migrate to Ory tutorial | Ory"|"This is a comprehensive guide on migrating an existing authentication system to Ory, a modern identity platform. The guide covers various aspects of the migration process, including setting up Ory, customizing the user interface, integrating with backend applications, exporting and importing identities, and transitioning from the old system.

Here are some key takeaways from the guide:

1. **Setting up Ory**: Start by setting up Ory in your development or staging environment to ensure a smooth migration process.
2. **Customizing the user interface**: Choose between using the built-in Account Experience or creating a custom UI that matches your existing design.
3. **Integrating with backend applications**: Forward cookies received from the frontend to validate sessions on backend calls to Ory's API.
4. **Exporting and importing identities**: Export user data from your existing authentication solution or database, hash credentials if necessary, and import them into Ory using the create identity API.
5. **Transition period**: Implement a transition period during which both the old system and Ory operate concurrently to minimize user disruption.
6. **Testing and stabilization**: Test the integration in your development or staging environment before going live with Ory in your production environment.

The guide also emphasizes best practices, such as:

1. **Storing business logic in your application database**: Keep authentication-relevant data in Ory and store business logic in your application database.
2. **Manually attaching relevant cookies to requests**: Ensure that backend calls to Ory's API include the necessary cookies for session validation.

Overall, this guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for migrating an existing authentication system to Ory, highlighting key considerations and best practices along the way."|"2025-01-29T12:08:53.927Z"

**Setting up a custom domain**

1. Go to the Ory Console and click on ""Custom Domains"".
2. Click on ""Add Custom Domain"" and enter your domain name.
3. The system will continuously check the status of your domain to ensure it's configured correctly.

**Verifying domain configuration**

1. Wait for up to 24 hours for your changes to propagate.
2. Manually recheck the custom domains page or check the value to set with your DNS provider by clicking the magnifying icon.
3. Once active, the Ory Account Experience is reachable at `https://<your-custom-domain>/ui/welcome`.

**CORS settings**

1. Update CORS settings independent of the custom domain or cookie domain settings when editing your custom domain entry.

**Email configuration**

1. Configure a custom SMTP server that matches at least the root domain of your custom domain.
2. Set up an email server that lives under your-custom-domain.com to prevent Gmail from marking emails as spam or blocking them entirely.

**CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) records**

1. Understand how CAA records work and their impact on your custom domain configuration.
2. Add pki.goog to your CAA record if you have one defined, either at the root domain level or subdomain level.

** DNS provider guides**

1. Use guides from popular DNS providers like Let's Encrypt, DNSimple, or others to set up CAA records.

Subject sets represent indirections in Ory Permissions, empowering flexibility with RBAC or inheritance of relations.

Subject sets can again indirect to subject sets, and empty relation refers to ""any relation"".

Applications use the same subject identifiers for internal use as they do for external use (e.g. UUIDv4).

Ory Permissions uses arbitrary strings as objects and strongly discourages encoding application data within the object.

Application must map incoming requests to a subject string representing attributes of the request using a UUID mapping.

Use UUIDs instead of encoding application data in object identifiers.
Ory Permissions uses arbitrary strings as objects, but recommend using UUIDs to map application data.
Application must pre-process and map incoming ""set value"" requests to corresponding UUIDs for Ory Permissions interpretation."|"2025-01-29T12:11:53.174Z"

"/docs/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities"|"Ory REST HTTP API Documentation | Ory"|"Here is a summary of the API documentation for the Ory Network:

**General Information**

* The Ory Network is a decentralized network that provides features such as secure communication, event handling, and data synchronization.
* The API is designed to be scalable, reliable, and performant.

**API Endpoints**

The following are some of the most commonly used API endpoints in the Ory Network:

1. **`/projects/{project_id}`**: Retrieves information about a project.
2. **`/workspaces/{workspace_id}`**: Retrieves information about a workspace.
3. **`/api_keys/{project_api_key_id}`**: Creates, updates or deletes an API key for a project.
4. **`/event_streams/{event_stream_id}`**: Removes an event stream from a project.
5. **`/ws/projects/{project_id}/workspaces/{workspace_name}`**: Retrieves a list of workspace projects for a project.

**Authentication**

* Authentication is performed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* Only authenticated users can access certain API endpoints.

**API Versioning**

* The Ory Network uses semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0) to version its APIs.
* Each major release introduces new features and breaking changes.
* Minor releases introduce backwards-compatible features.
* Patch releases are used for bug fixes and small feature additions.

**Rate Limiting**

* Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
* The rate limit varies depending on the endpoint and user type (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

**Error Handling**

* Errors are returned in JSON format with a standard error response code (e.g., 400 for bad request).
* Error messages provide information about what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

**Security Considerations**

* The Ory Network uses HTTPS and TLS Edge Termination for secure communication.
* Data encryption is used to protect sensitive data in transit.
* API keys are encrypted and stored securely on servers.

This summary provides an overview of the key features, endpoints, and security considerations for the Ory Network API."|"2025-01-29T12:13:27.336Z"

* Ory Identities uses anti-CSRF cookies with additional security measures to protect against browser attacks.
* HTTP cookies must be set on the same domain as the application consuming Ory APIs, otherwise they are ignored by browsers.
* When developing locally, tunnel Ory APIs on a port on the local machine to set cookies on the same domain.
* Ory issues HTTP cookies with flags for highest security, such as setting the domain to project slug.
* Browsers only accept cookies from matching domains and reject cookies sent to different top-level domains.
* Cross-origin AJAX requests require server-side support and use of credentials flag.
* Sending cross-domain cookies is deprecated in some browsers and planned for others.
* Ory supports JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management, but OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are also available for advanced use cases."|"2025-01-29T12:13:30.219Z"

1. Ory supports passwordless authentication via WebAuthn API for browser-based apps, integrating with W3C specifications.
2. Authenticators for passwordless are designed to be easy to use (e.g., biometric authenticators).
3. Core idea of phishing attack is tricking user into giving up password; passwordless authentication via WebAuthn is resistant due to:
   - No shared secrets during login
   - Domain verification
   - No password reuse
4. Main steps in passwordless login flow:
   - User enters ID and clicks ""Sign in with security key""
   - Frontend app requests verification of user's identity through WebAuthn API
   - Browser opens dialog asking user to choose authenticator; browser invokes chosen authenticator for verification
   - Browser returns signed challenge to frontend app, which forwards it to Ory Identities for verification
5. Public key and private key are stored separately, with only public key sent over network during registration flow.
6. Passkeys can be used for login across devices via WebAuthn's remote authentication protocol (BLE connection).
7. Support for transferring passkey credentials between devices is available on some platforms but not all.
8. Platform-specific mechanisms are available for sharing passkeys securely between devices (e.g., Apple iCloud Keychain)."|"2025-01-29T12:13:54.241Z"

Here's an overview of the main topics covered:

1. **Grant Types**: The text explains four grant types:
	* Authorization Code Flow
	* Implicit Grant (not recommended due to security concerns)
	* Device Code Flow
	* Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type (unsupported by Ory)
2. **Flows**: The guide covers the two main flows used with OAuth 2.0:
	* Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (recommended for native apps and single-page applications)
	* Device Code Flow (suitable for devices without a web browser)
3. **Best Practices**:
	* Server-side web applications should use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.
	* Mobile applications should also use the Authorization Code with PKCE flow, which provides greater security.
	* Single-page applications and mobile/native apps should avoid storing client secrets securely due to security concerns.
4. **Token Introspection**: The text mentions that resource servers use the OAuth 2.0 token introspection endpoint to verify access tokens before granting or denying access to protected resources.

Overall, this guide provides a detailed overview of OAuth 2.0 and its various grant types, flows, and best practices for implementing it in different scenarios. It's likely intended for developers who need to implement OAuth 2.0 in their applications."|"2025-01-29T12:14:07.636Z"

Access tokens are used to access protected resources, but not for authentication.
ID tokens cannot be used for API access purposes and access tokens cannot be used for authentication.
Client sends user to OpenID Provider with authentication request to obtain ID token, which is digitally signed and verified by the intended recipient.
ID token includes:
  - Issuer
  - Audience (client)
  - Nonce
  - Issue time
  - Expiration time
  - Claims about the user (e.g. name, email address)

Architecture Principles:
Platform responsible for horizontal scaling, configuration from environment variables and config files, and maintenance tasks run as one-off processes.
Concurrency mandated by UNIX process model.

Process Design:
Stateless and disposable processes with no shared state. Data persistence handled by a stateful backing service (e.g., RDBMS).

Configuration:
Environment variables and files used for configuration. JSON Schema validation to prevent misconfiguration.

Startup Time: Processes ready in milliseconds, shutting down gracefully when receiving SIGTERM signal.

Output Stream: Unbuffered writes to stdout and stderr. No concerns with routing or storage of output stream.

Process Formation: Array of processes handling regular business tasks (e.g., web requests). One-off admin processes run in identical environment as regular long-running processes.

Backed Services:
Consumed services accessed via URL or locator/credentials stored in config. Local and third-party services treated equally."|"2025-01-29T12:15:58.134Z"

"/docs/reference/api#operation/getIdentity"|"Ory REST HTTP API Documentation | Ory"|"This appears to be a documentation for an API (Application Programming Interface) used by Ory, a decentralized identity platform. The API provides various endpoints for managing projects, workspaces, event streams, and other related resources.

Here's a high-level overview of the API endpoints:

1. **Projects**:
	* Create a new project
	* Delete a project
	* List all projects
	* Get project details (including API keys)
2. **Workspaces**:
	* Create a new workspace
	* Delete a workspace
	* List all workspaces
	* Get workspace details (including API keys)
3. **Event Streams**:
	* Create an event stream
	* Delete an event stream
	* List all event streams
	* Get event stream details
4. **API Keys**:
	* Create a new API key for a project or workspace
	* Delete an API key
	* List all API keys
5. **Self-Hosted Server Metadata**:
	* Returns the version of Ory Kratos (only available when self-hosting the service)

Some common headers and query parameters used in the API endpoints:

* `Authorization`: Used for authentication, requires a token with project or workspace permissions.
* `Content-Type`: Set to `application/json` for JSON payload requests.
* `x-forwarded-proto`: Required for TLS Edge Termination (if supported).

The API uses HTTP methods such as `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Overall, the Ory API provides a robust set of endpoints for managing projects, workspaces, event streams, and API keys, with various authentication and authorization mechanisms in place."|"2025-01-29T12:16:29.145Z"

* The domain must be reachable and verified before CORS settings can be updated.

**CORS Status**

* The CORS status will show ""Inactive"" while the domain is pending verification.
* After verification, the CORS status will show ""Enabled/Disabled"".

**Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) Records**

* CAA records are used to authorize certificate authorities to issue certificates for a domain.
* If no CAA record is present, any CA is allowed to issue a certificate.
* If a CAA record is present, only the listed CAs are allowed to issue certificates.
* To use a custom hostname with Ory Network, add pki.goog as an authorized certificate authority to your CAA record.

**Custom SMTP Server**

* When using a custom domain without a custom SMTP server, links inside automated emails won't match the sender's domain.
* To prevent this, configure a custom SMTP server that matches at least the root domain of your custom domain.

**Other**

* The Ory Account Experience is reachable at https://<your-custom-domain>/ui/welcome once the domain is active.
* You can update CORS settings independently of the custom domain or cookie domain settings when editing the custom domain entry."|"2025-01-29T12:16:44.760Z"

**Authentication and Sessions**

1. `GET /auth/login` - Logs in a user
2. `GET /auth/logout` - Logs out a user
3. `POST /auth/session` - Creates a new session (invalidates existing ones)
4. `GET /auth/session/{id}` - Retrieves a specific session

**Session Management**

1. `POST /session/{id}/revoke` - Revokes a session (currently not possible)
2. `GET /session/{id}` - Retrieves a specific session data

**Email and SMS Message Delivery**

1. `GET /messages` - Lists all messages by status and recipient
	* `Items per Page`: Number of items to return per page
	* `Next Page Token`: Next page token for pagination
2. `GET /messages/{id}` - Retrieves a specific message

"/docs/kratos/reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/toSession"|"HTTP API documentation | Ory"|"This is an API documentation for an identity and access management system called Ory Kratos. It appears to be written in a natural language style, with detailed descriptions of each endpoint and its parameters.

Here are some key observations about the documentation:

1. **Endpoints**: The API has several endpoints, including:
	* `/api/v2/auth/`: authentication-related functions
	* `/api/v2/session/`: session management functions
	* `/api/v2/messages/`: message delivery management functions
	* `/api/v2/server-metadata/`: server metadata functions
2. **Authentication**: The API uses a token-based authentication system, where users obtain tokens upon successful login and must provide them for subsequent requests.
3. **Session Management**: The API allows users to create, update, and delete sessions, which appear to be tied to user identities.
4. **Message Delivery**: The API provides functions for sending messages (e.g., emails, SMS) and retrieving message delivery status.
5. **Server Metadata**: This endpoint returns information about the server's state, including its health and version.

Some specific questions or concerns that arise from this documentation include:

1. What is the authentication process like? Is it a simple token-based system or does it involve more complex authentication flows?
2. How do sessions work in Ory Kratos? Can users have multiple active sessions simultaneously, or are there limitations on session duration and creation?
3. What types of messages can be sent via this API (e.g., emails, SMS, etc.)? Are there any limitations on message content or size?
4. How does the server metadata endpoint work? Is it used for monitoring purposes or is it a way to communicate with clients about server state?

To answer these questions and provide more specific guidance, I would need to know more about the context in which this API is being used (e.g., client-side application, server-side service, etc.) and what specific requirements or use cases are being addressed by the API."|"2025-01-29T12:18:32.069Z"

**Setting up a custom domain**

1. Go to the Ory Console and click on ""Custom domains"".
2. Click on ""Add a custom domain"" and enter your desired domain name.
3. Set the correct DNS settings for your custom domain.

**Verifying the domain**

1. Wait for 24 hours for the changes to propagate.
2. Manually check the status of your custom domain by clicking on the magnifying icon next to it.
3. Once active, the Ory Account Experience is reachable at `https://<your-custom-domain>/ui/welcome`.

**CORS settings**

1. Update CORS settings independent of the custom domain or cookie domain settings.

**CAA records**

1. Check if your domain has a CAA record defined (can be done using tools like dig).
2. If you have a CAA record, add pki.goog to it to allow custom hostname usage.
3. If you don't have a CAA record, define one at the root domain or subdomain level.

**SMTP settings**

1. Configure a custom SMTP server that matches at least the root domain of your custom domain.
2. This prevents email providers from marking emails as spam or blocking them entirely.

**Propagating changes**

1. It can take up to 24 hours for changes to propagate.
2. Manually check the status of your custom domain by clicking on the magnifying icon next to it.

**Removing a custom domain**

1. You can remove your custom domain from the Console, but please note that any requests to it will no longer resolve once removed.

Ory creates spans which are encapsulated with the following state: 
 span_id 
 trace_id 
 parent_span_id
 status
  Ory creates the following spans:
   start_time 
   duration 
   end_time 

 Traces consist of one or more spans. Tracing configurations can be set via a configuration file or environment variables.

"/docs/hydra/faq"|"FAQ | Ory"|"Here is the summary of the documentation content:

Omitting Consent Redirection:
- You cannot skip the consent redirection flow entirely, but you can accept the redirection immediately.
- Ensure that the nonce and state parameters are set in the auth code URL.

Migrations:
- Migrations are no longer run automatically on boot, requiring manual initialization with `hydra migrate sql`.
- Many deployments use Docker, and it's recommended to extend the Ory Hydra Docker image.

TLS Certificates:
- Environment variables or flags can be used to import TLS certificates when running hydra host.

Entropy Error:
- The error is due to insufficient entropy in security parameters like anti-replay and anti-CSRF.
- Ensure that state and nonce are set in the auth code URL.

Logging and Debugging:
- Check logs using docker logs <container-id> for MySQL-related errors.
- Use `hydra serve --dev` to enable development mode.

12 Factor Principles:
- Hydra scales according to 12 factor principles, requiring only adding another instance with the same config.

Client Configuration:
- The grant_types parameter in the client can be used to whitelist specific flows.

Health Check:
- /health/alive and /health/ready endpoints can be used to test if the server is alive and ready (i.e., database connectivity works).

Omitting OpenID Authorization Code Grant Flow:
- It's configurable on a per-client basis, allowing for whitelisting specific flows."|"2025-01-29T12:19:42.248Z"
